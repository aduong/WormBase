Fetches the raw string value (i.e. no Ace object is made) of a tag in
an object.  If the tag could not be found, then undef is returned.

B<When to [not] use C<raw_fetch>>. C<raw_fetch> should be used when
fetching the value of an object's field only i.e. no Ace::Object needs
to be created. The performance gains are most apparent when fetching
the string (only) of many fields of an object. C<raw_fetch> should not
be used when the field data is large, as the gain is minimal. It
should not be used when the field contains escaped double-quotes. If
C<raw_fetch> I<must> be used on a field which can have escaped
double-quotes, read on.

C<raw_fetch> uses, by default, a simple matching pattern to extract the
value of a given tag.  If the simple pattern does not suffice, then a
more specialized pattern can be used by adding it to the PATTERN_CACHE
variable in this module. A CONCLUSIVE_PATTERN has been provided for
convenience and completeness which should work on any field but is
significantly slower than the simple pattern.
